# MVDparser: a Quakeworld Multi-View Demos (MVD) Parser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deurk/mvdparser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deurk/mvdparser)

In QuakeWorld and the popular server MVDSV, it is possible to record server side demos that include the views of all players on the map.

This program parses such demos and can output statistics about them in a customized format.
